This repository includes multiple compressed files used as supplementary data for different research publications.  Specifically, the files contain:

- 1_code.zip -- the source code for the Sensor Node, Base Station and Relay applications used in an ambulatory gait measurement system. This system uses SunSPOT devices and was developed by Mihaela I. Chidean and collaborators. 

	The complete description of this system can be found in the following journal paper:

	M. I. Chidean, E. del Arco, E. Morgado, J. Ramiro-Bargueño and A. J. Caamaño, 
	"Ambulatory Gait Measurement System for Natural Environments,"
